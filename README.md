In this paper,  we propose a graphical model by incorporating  user real preferences on various topics from user reviews, which naturally fuses Collaborative Filtering technique and Topic Modeling approach together for accurate merchant recommendation.   
Then, we develop an optimization algorithm based on a Gaussian model to train our merchant recommendation approach.  
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our model.
